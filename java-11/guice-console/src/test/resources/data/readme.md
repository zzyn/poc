# Test Case Name Rule

## http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/examples/inclusion-exclusion.html

```
By default, the Failsafe Plugin will automatically include all test classes with the following wildcard patterns:

"**/IT*.java" - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that start with "IT".
"**/*IT.java" - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "IT".
"**/*ITCase.java" - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "ITCase".
```
