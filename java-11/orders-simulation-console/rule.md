Great chatting earlier, Zack.

Per the next steps, please complete the attached challenge and let me know if you have any questions.

As I mentioned on the call, we expect clean and maintainable code that you feel proud to deploy to production. Here are a couple of important things to keep in mind when youâ€™re working on the coding challenge.

 

* Use modern languages and paradigms - knows the newest version of the code

* Good documentation/ReadMe

* Unit/system test coverage in the code

* READABLE code

* Simple, scalable, and maintainable architecture

* Well thought out product solution

* Address ALL of the requirements and deliverables listed in the assignment pdf

* Follow best practices for code format/language

* Watch for circular dependencies

* Decouple components

* Good caching/multi-threading models

 

Looking forward to what you come up with!

 

 

Thanks,

Linva
